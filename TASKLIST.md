#Task List
A list of things I'd like to add, or things that are planned

# `ui.View` classes
- [x] `PathView` class for easily displaying shapes in a UI
  - Perhaps the existing polygon classes should inherit from this?
- [x] Progress bar
  - Should have styling options
- [x] NewPath class
  - [x] Basics
  - [x] Scaling and stretching the whole path - implemented via `Pathview`
- [ ] `AccordionView` class - See [this](http://materializecss.com/collapsible.html)

# Misc
- [ ] Create `.pyui` files from in-memory `ui.View` objects - Individual components can be created with their subviews, but not the top-level metadata.
- [ ] Test suite
